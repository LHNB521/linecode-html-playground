  // 1. Validate the site name (no special chars, etc.)
  // 2. Check if the name is already taken
  // 3. Save the HTML to a file or database

  // This is a simplified example - in a real app, you'd use a database
  // or file storage service instead of this approach

  // For demo purposes, we'll just return the URL that would be created
  const url = `https://play.linecode.top/${siteName}`

  // to a location that Nginx would serve
